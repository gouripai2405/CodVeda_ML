🚀 Codveda Technologies – Machine Learning Internship Tasks
This repository contains all major tasks completed during my Machine Learning Internship at Codveda Technologies. Each task demonstrates key concepts in data preprocessing, supervised learning, model evaluation, and visualization using Python.

📌 Task Overview
Task 1: Data Preprocessing for Machine Learning
Handles missing data (mean/median imputation and dropping).
Encodes categorical features (Label Encoding / One-Hot Encoding).
Scales numerical features using normalization/standardization.
Splits data into training and testing sets.
Demonstrates use of pandas, scikit-learn.

Task 2: Simple Linear Regression
Trains a linear regression model to predict a continuous target variable.
Interprets model coefficients and performance using R² and MSE.
Demonstrates LinearRegression from scikit-learn.

Task 3: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier
Implements KNN on a labeled dataset.
Compares performance for different k values.
Uses accuracy, confusion matrix, and precision/recall for evaluation.

Task 4: Logistic Regression for Binary Classification
Trains a logistic regression model to predict binary outcomes (e.g., customer churn).
Evaluates model with accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC curve.
Highlights model interpretation using odds ratios.

Task 5: Decision Tree Classifier
Builds and visualizes a decision tree using the Iris dataset.
Evaluates with classification metrics and avoids overfitting via pruning.

Task 6: Random Forest Classifier
Applies Random Forest to a sentiment dataset.
Includes hyperparameter tuning and feature importance analysis.
Evaluated with precision, recall, F1-score, and cross-validation.

Task 7: Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier
Trains SVM with linear and RBF kernels.
Visualizes decision boundaries.
Evaluated with accuracy, classification report, and AUC score.

🛠️ Tools Used
Python 3
Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

📌 Notes
Tasks are structured for hands-on learning with real datasets (Iris, Housing, Sentiment, Churn).
Focused on clarity, reproducibility, and best practices.
Each script can be run independently using standard Python environments (Jupyter/Colab/VSCode).
